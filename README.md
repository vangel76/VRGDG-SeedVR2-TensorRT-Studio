# VRGDG SeedVR2 TensorRT Studio

Local, GPU-accelerated video restoration and upscaling with SeedVR2, TensorRT, and a purpose-built browser interface.

VRGDG SeedVR2 TensorRT Studio turns the SeedVR2 pipeline into a practical Windows workflow: load a video, test a short preview, compare the result frame by frame, and complete long renders with resumable checkpoints. Processing stays on your machine.

## Highlights

- **Fast local restoration** — SeedVR2 inference with TensorRT-accelerated VAE decoding on supported NVIDIA RTX GPUs.
- **Fast 2K upscaling** — As a real-world example, an 8-second clip took approximately 8 minutes to upscale to 2K on an NVIDIA RTX 5090 using the largest **7B Sharp FP16** model. Render times vary with source resolution, frame rate, settings, and available VRAM.
- **Preview before committing** — render a short segment, then inspect Original, Restored, Compare, or Side by side views.
- **Long-render recovery** — save completed chunks and continue from the first unfinished chunk after an interruption.
- **Practical output controls** — choose resolution, aspect policy, model precision, temporal batch, seed, and color correction.
- **Non-destructive finishing** — reprocess sharpening, grain, seam smoothing, and optional skin finishing without rerunning restoration.
- **Project-based history** — reopen previous outputs and keep media, manifests, and logs together under `outputs\`.

## Requirements

| | Recommended setup |
|---|---|
| Operating system | Windows 11 |
| GPU | NVIDIA RTX with a current driver |
| Storage | At least 35 GB free |
| Network | Internet connection for the first installation |
| Python | Installed automatically when needed; the project requires Python 3.12+ |

TensorRT engines are built locally for the installed GPU and runtime. Do not copy `.rtxplan` files between different GPU models or TensorRT versions.

## Quick start

**Linux / CachyOS:** use `./scripts/install.sh`, then `./run.sh`.
See the [Linux setup guide](docs/LINUX.md) for prerequisites and validation.

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Double-click **Install SeedVR Studio.bat** and leave the window open until setup completes.
3. Double-click **Launch SeedVR Studio Pro.bat**.
4. Drop a source video into the Media panel.
5. Render a short preview, inspect it, and then render the full video.

The installer prepares the private Python environment, FFmpeg, CUDA PyTorch, SeedVR2, SageAttention 2, TensorRT RTX, model weights, and GPU-specific engines. Downloads and engine preparation are resumable. The Pro launcher also detects an incomplete setup and opens the installer automatically.

For repair options and troubleshooting, see the [installation guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

## How to update

### Update from inside Studio

If the **update button (↻)** is visible beside **Exit Studio**:

1. Finish or stop any active render.
2. Click **↻** to check the `main` update channel.
3. If an update is available, click **Update and restart**.

Studio closes, downloads only the changed application files, refreshes Python dependencies only when required, and then restarts automatically. Models, GPU-specific TensorRT engines, `.venv`, outputs, manifests, logs, and saved settings remain in place.

The safe updater requires a clean Git-backed installation on the `main` branch. It refuses to overwrite tracked local edits or diverged Git history. If dependency repair fails after an update, it restores the previous application revision automatically.

### One-time update for existing installations

Users who do not yet see the **↻ button** can install the update system with one final manual update:

1. Download [`Update SeedVR Studio.bat`](bootstrap/Update%20SeedVR%20Studio.bat).
2. Place the downloaded BAT beside `Launch SeedVR Studio Pro.bat` in the existing Studio folder.
3. Completely close SeedVR Studio.
4. Double-click `Update SeedVR Studio.bat`.

The one-time updater downloads the current application code, creates an application-code backup under `outputs\`, and restarts Studio. It preserves the existing `.venv`, downloaded models, TensorRT engines, rendered videos, browser-saved settings, and other untracked user files.

For installations originally downloaded as a ZIP, this step also converts the existing folder into a clean Git-backed `main` installation. After it finishes, future updates use the **↻ button** inside Studio.

## Workflow

### 1. Load and inspect media

Drop a video onto the Media panel or browse for a file. After a preview or full render completes, use the viewer tabs to switch between the source and restored result.

| Load a source | Choose a viewer mode |
|---|---|
| ![Media panel with the original-video drop zone](images/ui-guide/controls/media-input.png) | ![Original, Restored, Compare, and Side by side viewer tabs](images/ui-guide/controls/viewer-modes.png) |

- **Original** shows the uploaded source.
- **Restored** shows the latest rendered result.
- **Compare** overlays the restored video with a draggable wipe divider.
- **Side by side** places both videos next to each other.

The shared viewer also supports timeline scrubbing, frame stepping, synchronized playback, fullscreen, zoom, and pan.

### 2. Choose the render path and target

Start with **SeedVR2 + TensorRT** for the accelerated path, then select a hardware preset and output target. Presets provide sensible starting values; **Custom / manual** leaves every setting under your control.

| Render engine | Hardware preset | Output and aspect |
|---|---|---|
| ![SeedVR2 and TensorRT render-engine selector](images/ui-guide/controls/render-engine.png) | ![Hardware preset selector](images/ui-guide/controls/hardware-preset.png) | ![Output-size and crop-policy selectors](images/ui-guide/controls/output-and-crop.png) |

Output presets include original-size enhancement, 1K/1080p, 2K/1440p, and 4K/2160p. Preserve the source aspect ratio or center-crop it to 16:9.

### 3. Tune restoration

Choose the model, temporal batch, seed, and color-matching strategy. FP8 models use less VRAM; FP16 models prioritize quality and require more memory. Temporal batches follow SeedVR2's `4n+1` rule, while the TensorRT path currently supports batches **5** and **21**.

| Model, batch, and seed | Color correction | Resumable rendering |
|---|---|---|
| ![Model, temporal-batch, and seed controls](images/ui-guide/controls/model-batch-seed.png) | ![Color-correction selector and available modes](images/ui-guide/controls/color-correction.png) | ![Resumable long-video render and chunk-length controls](images/ui-guide/controls/resumable-render.png) |

Color correction is applied during the main restoration. Use `none` to retain source colors; `lab` is a useful general-purpose matching mode. The other available modes are `wavelet`, `wavelet_adaptive`, `hsv`, and `adain`.

For long videos, enable resumable rendering. **Auto** selects a chunk length from the duration, frame count, frame rate, and temporal batch; manual choices range from 30 seconds to 30 minutes. Completed chunks remain available if a job stops, and **Retry from last chunk** continues at the first unfinished section.

### 4. Balance speed, memory, and finishing

TensorRT uses **Optimized Fast** decoding automatically. If it fails, the Studio retries the saved latents with its internal Stable decoder, avoiding another restoration pass.

| Performance | Post-processing | Skin finishing |
|---|---|---|
| ![Attention, block swapping, and VAE-tiling controls](images/ui-guide/controls/performance.png) | ![Sharpening, film grain, and seam-smoothing controls](images/ui-guide/controls/post-processing.png) | ![Optional skin-finishing controls](images/ui-guide/controls/skin-finishing.png) |

- **Attention:** SageAttention 2 is the preferred default. Missing accelerated backends fall through to another installed option and finally SDPA.
- **Blocks to swap:** higher values reduce VRAM demand but cost speed.
- **VAE tiling:** reduces memory use at a speed cost; leave it off unless VRAM is insufficient.
- **Smooth TensorRT batch seams:** matches color and noise around decoded batch boundaries and is enabled by default.
- **Skin finishing:** uses a stabilized skin mask to refine existing pixels. It is non-generative and cannot recreate missing facial identity detail; preview stronger settings first.

Post-processing can be changed later with **Reprocess post only**, without rerunning SeedVR2.

### 5. Preview, render, and reopen results

Set a short preview range, render it, and compare the result before starting the complete video. The status bar reports readiness, elapsed time, and ETA while a job runs.

| Preview range | Render actions |
|---|---|
| ![Preview start and length fields](images/ui-guide/controls/preview-range.png) | ![Reprocess, preview, and full-render buttons](images/ui-guide/controls/render-actions.png) |

| Render status | Previous results |
|---|---|
| ![Ready state, elapsed time, ETA, power, and fullscreen controls](images/ui-guide/controls/render-status.png) | ![Previous-results selector and load button](images/ui-guide/controls/previous-results.png) |

Every job receives its own folder under `outputs\` with rendered media, manifests, and logs. Use **Load selected output** to reopen a result from the current workspace.

## Render engines

| Engine | Best for | Temporal batches | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| **SeedVR2 + TensorRT** | Recommended accelerated workflow | 5, 21 | Uses TensorRT VAE decoding and automatic fallback from saved latents. |
| **SeedVR2 (Legacy)** | Compatibility and additional batch choices | SeedVR2-compatible values | Standard PyTorch path; can be substantially slower on long videos. |
| **RTX Video Super Resolution** | Very fast upscaling of clean sources | Any size up to 4× per pass (larger factors chain passes) | NVIDIA Video Effects SDK (`nvidia-vfx`); no SeedVR2 model, hundreds of frames per second. Post effects, face restoration and reprocess still apply. |

The temporal-batch menu updates automatically when the render engine changes.

## Settings that matter most

- Begin with the hardware preset closest to your VRAM capacity.
- Use a short representative preview before every long render.
- Increase temporal batch only when the selected engine and available VRAM support it.
- Use block swapping or VAE tiling when memory is the limiting factor, accepting the speed tradeoff.
- Keep skin finishing subtle and confirm faces, freckles, moles, and other permanent marks in the preview.
- Use post-only reprocessing for finishing changes; it is much faster than repeating restoration.
